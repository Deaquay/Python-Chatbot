Get your api keys in new private browser window for each key and new proxy for each key on https://cohere.com .

Insert api keys and for easy management keep them in bat file .choose-ai and rotate them as needed. 

Note the date when the key is spent in the file so you know when it resets. They reset once per month and iirc are 1000 api calls.
